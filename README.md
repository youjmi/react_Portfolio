## Description

Welcome to my React Portfolio.  I am pleased to present to you and your competitive employers what I have to offer as a contributor. In my Portfolio, you will be able to find all necessary information on who I am, my projects I am most proud of, my Resume and Cover Letter, and lastly, a working Contact Me Page.

## Usage 

1.  First Picture: Once clicking on the Deployed Link, you will see my Home Page. You will noticed that the background for all pages have a moving Video MP4.  In the Footer, my Social Icons are responsive to Hover and will direct you to the linked associated pages when clicked.

2.  Second Picture: Here are the works that I have recently completed and are confident to present to employers and technical recruiters. You will also notice that all boxes are responsive to Hover. This feature is showing on the top 3rd box. It enlarges and changes color to blue. All boxes when clicked will direct you to the deployed links or published videos. There are additional button features on the bottom of each box.
